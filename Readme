This is an attempt at creating an implementation of the Scheme
programming language. The aim is to do so from scratch, in the sense
of not using an existing Scheme implementation as part of its
upbringing, but in the end have at least the higher levels of the
system written in Scheme.

The aim is to learn how to build a programming language implementation
from scratch. A secondary aim is to learn how to achieve a result that
is fully secure, or learn what's missing in capabilities to do so
(security meaning that through modification of program inputs the
system cannot be led into an undefined state, that separate programs
running on the same system cannot influence each other in different
than predetermined ways, and that facilities are there for program
writers to handle I/O deterministically). We'll try to avoid major
performance pitfalls but performance is not one of the primary aims.
